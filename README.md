## How to play the game

This is a 2-player game where players take turns making their moves. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. Each player takes turns to make their moves.
2. When you are satisfied with your round or if you run out of stamina, click End Turn. This resets your position, and it becomes the next player's turn.
3. After both players have completed their turns, the Resolve moves phase begins. During this phase, players moves gets executed at the same time.
4. If a player is hit by an attack, they lose health. The game ends when one player's health reaches zero, and the other player is declared the winner.
5. TRAITOR: Play with someone you trust, or they just might look over your shoulder and betray you!!!
